This is an analysis of stock price behavior based on the Kaggle dataset of all SP-500 stocks in the past 5 years.

 - in the first part, I analyze the daily changes of a random stock, and argue that the distribution of changes is not normal, as assumed in the model of stock prices as geom. Brownian motion. The main reason for this seems to be the too-fat tails.
 - in the second part, I construct a market portfolio (or an approximation), and compare individual stocks with this portfolio.
